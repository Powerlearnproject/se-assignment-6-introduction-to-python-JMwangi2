# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
     Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Key features that make it popular include:

•  Simplicity and Readability: Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive and mirrors the English language, which makes it an excellent choice for beginners.

•  Versatility: It can be used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

•  Extensive Libraries: Python has a vast standard library and many third-party libraries, allowing developers to add functionality without writing additional code.

Python is particularly effective in data analysis, machine learning, automation, and web development.


2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
     To install Python:

1. 
Download the Python installer from the official website.
2. 
Run the installer and follow the prompts. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".
3. 
After installation, open a command prompt or terminal and type python --version to verify the installation.
4. 
To set up a virtual environment, use the command python -m venv myenv, replacing myenv with your desired environment name.


3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
     print("Hello, World!")

This program uses the print() function to output the string "Hello, World!" to the console.


4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
     ython's basic data types include:

•  Integers: Whole numbers without a fractional part.

•  Floats: Numbers with a decimal point.

•  Strings: Sequences of characters.

•  Booleans: True or False values.

integer_var = 10
float_var = 20.5
string_var = "Hello"
boolean_var = True


5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
     Conditional statements and loops are used for controlling the flow of a program. An if-else statement allows for branching based on conditions, and a for loop allows for iterating over a sequence.

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
     Here's a function that sums two numbers:

def add_numbers(a, b):
return a + b

# Example of calling the function
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8


7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
     Lists are ordered collections of items, while dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. Here's a script demonstrating both:

# List of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3]

# Dictionary with key-value pairs
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}

# Basic operations
numbers.append(4)  # Adding to a list
person["name"] = "Bob"  # Updating a dictionary


8. Exception Handling:
Exception handling in Python uses try, except, and finally blocks to handle errors gracefully. Here's an example:

try:
result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
print("Cannot divide by zero.")
finally:
print("This always executes.")
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
     Modules and packages are collections of Python code that can be imported and used in scripts. To use the math module:

import math

print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0


     
10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
For file I/O, you can use the open() function. Here's how to read from a file:

with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
content = file.read()
print(content)

And here's how to write to a file:

lines = ["First line", "Second line"]
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
for line in lines:
file.write(line + "\n")



# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
